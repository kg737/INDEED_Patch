\title{INDEED: A package for biomarker candidate prioritization.}
\description{
The INDEED package provides an important functions below:
select_rho_partial, partial_cor, non_partial_cor and network_display.
}
\section{select_rho_partial function}{

select_rho_partial function preprocess data for partical correlation analysis,
the result contains list of preprocessed data and rho values and
error plot for user to choose desired rho value
}

\section{partial_cor function}{

partial_cor function performs partical correlation analysis
based on user input preprocessed list from select_rho_partial step
and the rho choosing method or rho of their choice
and number of permutations (default 1000), p-value is optional,
the result of score table and differential network will be returned
}

\section{non_partial_cor function}{

non_partial_cor function performs correlation analysis
based on user input data, class label, p-value, sample id,
number of permutations, and method (default pearson)
p value is optional,
the result of score table and differential network will be returned
}

\section{network_display function}{

A tool to assist in the network visualization of the results from INDEED functions patial_cor()
and non_partial_cor().
}
